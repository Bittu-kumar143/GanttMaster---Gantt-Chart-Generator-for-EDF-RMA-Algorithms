# GanttMaster-Gantt Chart Generator for EDF RMA Algorithms

GanttMaster is a web-based tool designed to generate Gantt charts for **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)** and **Rate Monotonic Algorithm (RMA)** scheduling algorithms. It allows users to visualize scheduling decisions in real-time, making it easier to understand the behavior of both algorithms.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The project includes:

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for UI and Gantt chart generation  
- **Back-end Logic**: JavaScript-based real-time scheduling algorithms (EDF & RMA)  
- **Interactive Controls**: Set process arrival time with sliders and choose the number of processes dynamically

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🎛 **Set Arrival Time** using an interactive slider for each process  
- 🔢 **Choose the Number of Processes** dynamically  
- 🗓 **EDF and RMA Algorithms**: Generate real-time Gantt charts using both scheduling strategies  
- 🌈 **Color-coded Gantt Chart**: Each process block is represented with a unique color  
- 🔗 **Dynamic Process Visualization**: No breaks between processes in the Gantt chart  
- 🕒 **Display Arrival and End Times** for each process below the chart  
- 📊 **Horizontal Gantt Chart Layout** with smooth transitions between process blocks

## 📌 Usage

1. Set the number of processes you want to visualize in the Gantt chart.  
2. Use the arrival time slider to set individual process arrival times.  
3. Choose between **EDF** or **RMA** scheduling algorithms.  
4. Click **"Generate Gantt Chart"** to visualize the results.  
5. Observe the arrival and end times of each process below the chart.
